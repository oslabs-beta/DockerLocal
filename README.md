## Running the tests

Run npm test in the terminal. 

```
$ npm test
```

Currently, Jest CLI has set up to run all test suites and display individual test results with the test suite hierarchy.

### Testing React Components
We're using: 
- Jest, a test runner
- Enzyme, a testing utility for React

In jest.config.js file:
- ts-jest preset to compile Typescript to JavaScript 
- enzyme-to-json to convert Enzyme wrappers for Jest snappshot matcher.
